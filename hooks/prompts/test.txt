## Response Format

You must respond in the following JSON format:

```json
{
  "severity": "OK|LOW|MEDIUM|HIGH|CRITICAL",
  "issues": [
    {
      "description": "Issue description",
      "severity": "OK|LOW|MEDIUM|HIGH|CRITICAL",
      "location": "Test class/method name (optional)",
      "suggestion": "Improvement suggestion (optional)"
    }
  ]
}
```

- OK: All tests pass, coverage sufficient
- LOW: Additional testing recommended
- MEDIUM: Some tests failing or insufficient coverage
- HIGH: Key feature tests failing
- CRITICAL: Core feature tests failing or security tests failing
